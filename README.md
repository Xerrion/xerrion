## 👤 About Me

I'm not chasing the latest framework hype. I believe in pragmatic solutions — picking the right tool for the job, even if it's not the shiniest one. Sometimes that's Rust, sometimes it's a bash script, sometimes it's just a well-structured spreadsheet.

I spend my time here on GitHub doing hobby projects and self-taught challenges. Most of them are works-in-progress — but that's half the fun!

## 💼 Work

**Currently at [TV 2 Danmark](https://tv2.dk/)** — Denmark's biggest TV station and streaming service. I build internal tools that help people do their jobs better. It's the kind of work where you don't get much glory, but you know you're making a difference when someone says *"that used to take me 2 hours, now it takes 5 minutes."*

Before TV 2, I worked in **satellite communications**. Yes, actual satellites in space. It was as cool as it sounds, and it taught me a lot about building systems that absolutely cannot fail.

## 🐕 Charlie

The real star of the show. Charlie is my Golden Retriever and the best co-worker I've ever had. He's excellent at reminding me to take breaks (read: demanding walks) and provides moral support during debugging sessions.
